/*
You can use typedef to give a name to your user defined data types as well. For example, you
can use typedef with structure to define a new data type and then use that data type to define
structure variables directly as follows âˆ’

typedef struct Books {
 char title[50];
 char author[50];
 char subject[100];
 int book_id;
} Book;
