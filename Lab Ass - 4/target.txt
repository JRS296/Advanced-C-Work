I still h!ve ! dre!m. It is ! dre!m deeply rooted in the !meric!n dre!m.
I h!ve ! dre!m th!t one d!y this n!tion will rise up !nd live out the true me!ning of its creed.
We hold these truths to 5e self-evident th!t !ll men !re cre!ted equ!l.
I h!ve ! dre!m th!t one d!y out in the red hills of Georgi! the sons of former sl!ves !nd the
sons of former sl!veowners will 5e !5le to sit down together !t the t!5le of 5rotherhood.
I h!ve ! dre!m th!t one d!y even the st!te of Mississippi, ! st!te sweltering with the he!t of
oppression, will 5e tr!nsformed into !n o!sis of freedom !nd justice.
I h!ve ! dre!m th!t my four little children will one d!y live in ! n!tion where they will not 5e
judged 5y the color of their skin 5ut 5y their ch!r!cter.
I h!ve ! dre!m tod!y.
I h!ve ! dre!m th!t one d!y down in !l!5!m!, with its vicious r!cists, with its governor
h!ving his lips dripping with the words of interposition !nd nullific!tion; th!t one d!y right
down in !l!5!m! little 5l!ck 5oys !nd 5l!ck girls will 5e !5le to join h!nds with little white
5oys !nd white girls !s sisters !nd 5rothers.
I h!ve ! dre!m tod!y.
I h!ve ! dre!m th!t one d!y every v!lley sh!ll 5e engulfed, every hill sh!ll 5e ex!lted !nd
every mount!in sh!ll 5e m!de low, the rough pl!ces will 5e m!de pl!ins !nd the crooked
pl!ces will 5e m!de str!ight !nd the glory of the Lord sh!ll 5e reve!led !nd !ll flesh sh!ll see
it together.
This is our hope. This is the f!ith th!t I will go 5!ck to the South with. With this f!ith we will
5e !5le to hew out of the mount!in of desp!ir ! stone of hope.
With this f!ith we will 5e !5le to tr!nsform the j!ngling discords of our n!tion into ! 5e!utiful
symphony of 5rotherhood.
With this f!ith we will 5e !5le to work together, to pr!y together, to struggle together, to go to
j!il together, to clim5 up for freedom together, knowing th!t we will 5e free one d!y.
This will 5e the d!y when !ll of God’s children will 5e !5le to sing with new me!ning “My
country ’tis of thee, sweet l!nd of li5erty, of thee I sing. L!nd where my f!ther’s died, l!nd of
the Pilgrim’s pride, from every mount!inside, let freedom ring!”
!nd if !meric! is to 5e ! gre!t n!tion, this must 5ecome true. So let freedom ring from the
hilltops of New H!mpshire. Let freedom ring from the mighty mount!ins of New York.
Let freedom ring from the heightening !lleghenies of Pennsylv!ni!.
Let freedom ring from the snow-c!pped Rockies of Color!do.
Let freedom ring from the curv!ceous slopes of C!liforni!.
5ut not only th!t, let freedom, ring from Stone Mount!in of Georgi!.
Let freedom ring from every hill !nd molehill of Mississippi !nd every mount!inside.
