I STILL HAVE A DREAM. IT IS A DREAM DEEPLY ROOTED IN THE AMERICAN DREAM.
I HAVE A DREAM THAT ONE DAY THIS NATION WILL RISE UP AND LIVE OUT THE TRUE MEANING OF ITS CREED.
WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDENT THAT ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL.
I HAVE A DREAM THAT ONE DAY OUT IN THE RED HILLS OF GEORGIA THE SONS OF FORMER SLAVES AND THE
SONS OF FORMER SLAVEOWNERS WILL BE ABLE TO SIT DOWN TOGETHER AT THE TABLE OF BROTHERHOOD.
I HAVE A DREAM THAT ONE DAY EVEN THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI, A STATE SWELTERING WITH THE HEAT OF
OPPRESSION, WILL BE TRANSFORMED INTO AN OASIS OF FREEDOM AND JUSTICE.
I HAVE A DREAM THAT MY FOUR LITTLE CHILDREN WILL ONE DAY LIVE IN A NATION WHERE THEY WILL NOT BE
JUDGED BY THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN BUT BY THEIR CHARACTER.
I HAVE A DREAM TODAY.
I HAVE A DREAM THAT ONE DAY DOWN IN ALABAMA, WITH ITS VICIOUS RACISTS, WITH ITS GOVERNOR
HAVING HIS LIPS DRIPPING WITH THE WORDS OF INTERPOSITION AND NULLIFICATION; THAT ONE DAY RIGHT
DOWN IN ALABAMA LITTLE BLACK BOYS AND BLACK GIRLS WILL BE ABLE TO JOIN HANDS WITH LITTLE WHITE
BOYS AND WHITE GIRLS AS SISTERS AND BROTHERS.
I HAVE A DREAM TODAY.
I HAVE A DREAM THAT ONE DAY EVERY VALLEY SHALL BE ENGULFED, EVERY HILL SHALL BE EXALTED AND
EVERY MOUNTAIN SHALL BE MADE LOW, THE ROUGH PLACES WILL BE MADE PLAINS AND THE CROOKED
PLACES WILL BE MADE STRAIGHT AND THE GLORY OF THE LORD SHALL BE REVEALED AND ALL FLESH SHALL SEE
IT TOGETHER.
THIS IS OUR HOPE. THIS IS THE FAITH THAT I WILL GO BACK TO THE SOUTH WITH. WITH THIS FAITH WE WILL
BE ABLE TO HEW OUT OF THE MOUNTAIN OF DESPAIR A STONE OF HOPE.
WITH THIS FAITH WE WILL BE ABLE TO TRANSFORM THE JANGLING DISCORDS OF OUR NATION INTO A BEAUTIFUL
SYMPHONY OF BROTHERHOOD.
WITH THIS FAITH WE WILL BE ABLE TO WORK TOGETHER, TO PRAY TOGETHER, TO STRUGGLE TOGETHER, TO GO TO
JAIL TOGETHER, TO CLIMB UP FOR FREEDOM TOGETHER, KNOWING THAT WE WILL BE FREE ONE DAY.
THIS WILL BE THE DAY WHEN ALL OF GOD¬ÄôS CHILDREN WILL BE ABLE TO SING WITH NEW MEANING ¬ÄåMY
COUNTRY ¬ÄôTIS OF THEE, SWEET LAND OF LIBERTY, OF THEE I SING. LAND WHERE MY FATHER¬ÄôS DIED, LAND OF
THE PILGRIM¬ÄôS PRIDE, FROM EVERY MOUNTAINSIDE, LET FREEDOM RING!¬Äù
AND IF AMERICA IS TO BE A GREAT NATION, THIS MUST BECOME TRUE. SO LET FREEDOM RING FROM THE
HILLTOPS OF NEW HAMPSHIRE. LET FREEDOM RING FROM THE MIGHTY MOUNTAINS OF NEW YORK.
LET FREEDOM RING FROM THE HEIGHTENING ALLEGHENIES OF PENNSYLVANIA.
LET FREEDOM RING FROM THE SNOW-CAPPED ROCKIES OF COLORADO.
LET FREEDOM RING FROM THE CURVACEOUS SLOPES OF CALIFORNIA.
BUT NOT ONLY THAT, LET FREEDOM, RING FROM STONE MOUNTAIN OF GEORGIA.
LET FREEDOM RING FROM EVERY HILL AND MOLEHILL OF MISSISSIPPI AND EVERY MOUNTAINSIDE.
