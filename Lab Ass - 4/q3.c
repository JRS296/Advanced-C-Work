//Q3 - Write a program to encrypt/decrypt a file using a substitution ciper: in this each character read
//from the source file is substituted by a corresponding predetermined character and this
//character is written to the target file.
//For example, if character ‘A’ is read from the source file, and if we have decided that every ‘A’ is
//to be substituted by ‘!’, then a ‘!’ would be written to the target file in place of every ‘A’.
